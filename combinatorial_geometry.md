# Convex Geometric Hypergraph

* A convex geometric hypergraph or cgh is a family of subsets of a set of points in strictly convex position in the plane
* We assume these points, denoted by $\Omega_n = {v_0, v_1, . . . , v_{n−1}}$, are the vertices of some regular n-gon with the clockwise cylic ordering $v_0 < v_1 < · · · < v_{n−1} < v_0$.
* Let the extremal function $ex_\circlearrowright(n,F)$ denote the maximum number of edges in an r-uniform cgh on n points that does not contain F – *an F-free cgh*
* In this paper, we concentrated on intersection patterns of pairs of triangles (r = 3)

#### Theorem 1 (partial)

For all $n ≥ 3$, if $H$ is an extremal n-vertex $M_1$-free cgh, then $H ∈ \mathcal{H}'(n)$ and:

$$ex_\circlearrowright(n,M_1) = \triangle(n) + \frac{n(n-3)}{2}$$
